            <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
            <p>
                Definition: “A negative attitude, of which one is not consciously aware, against a specific social group. Implicit bias is thought to be shaped by experience and based on learned associations between particular qualities and social categories, including race and/or gender. Implicit bias is an aspect of implicit social cognition: the phenomenon that perceptions, attitudes, and stereotypes can operate prior to conscious intention or endorsement.”

            We discussed how implicit biases are unconscious and are constantly dictating our thoughts, actions, and emotions whether we realize it or not. Bias isn't always intentional. This made us realize how we need to be more aware of our unconscious biases and work to address them. Instead of just ignoring biases or assuming we are not influenced by them, it is crucial we become more mindful and address them. In order to progress, we must understand implicit biases. In the video below, we explore exactly what implicit bias is.

            Brenda Álvarez breaks down implicit bias, microaggressions, and how they shape everyday interactions, especially in education. It highlights stories from educators and trainers working toward equity and inclusion. We recommend paying extra attention to the 7 Ways to Reduce Implicit Bias at the end—they’re practical steps to reflect, grow, and do better.

        <p>
            The Implicit Bias Test (IBT) measures unconscious biases. After taking a few of the tests, we had an eye-opening experience. The structure of the test doesn’t allow time to think, showing us true results. However, the IAT is just one tool and doesn’t capture all layers of bias.

        <h2>Our Thoughts on Implicit Bias</h2>
        <p>
            As a group, we realized just how much of an influence implicit biases shape society. The class readings highlighted how biases in tech must be addressed as these systems further contribute to inequality. We concluded that powerful individuals in the technology realm must work on increasing equality and bridging the digital divide. As a society, we must strive to be better.

    <!-- Section 5: Understanding Intersectionality -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>Understanding Intersectionality</h2>
        <p>
            Intersectionality explains how our various identities—such as race, gender, class, and sexuality—intersect to shape our experiences in the world. As Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Bilge (2016) state, “People's lives and the organization of power in society are better understood as being shaped not by a single axis of social division, but by many axes that work together and influence each other.” This means that no one aspect of our identity exists in isolation—our challenges and privileges arise from the overlapping systems of power and oppression we navigate every day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined the term intersectionality, emphasized in her work that failing to consider these intersections can erase the experiences of individuals facing multiple forms of discrimination. For example, in her TED Talk (below), she highlights how legal systems and activism often overlook the compounded discrimination that Black women face due to both racism and sexism. This demonstrates why intersectionality is essential for understanding the full scope of inequality.

        </div>
        <p>
            For a simpler breakdown, the video below explains intersectionality with relatable examples, such as workplace discrimination and societal biases. It connects the theory to everyday life and reinforces why understanding these intersections is critical for addressing inequality effectively.

        </div>
        <p>
            Lastly, intersectionality challenges us to consider how systems like racism, sexism, ableism, and classism reinforce one another. For instance, as we discussed in class, policies that appear neutral may unintentionally disadvantage certain groups if they fail to consider how intersecting identities impact access to opportunities and resources. By applying an intersectional lens, we can work toward creating more inclusive solutions that account for the diversity and complexity of human experiences.
