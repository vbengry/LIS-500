            <p>
                On this page, we're sharing our journey with a machine learning experiment using Teachable Machines. The goal was to create a voice or image classification algorithm while gaining insights into the biases and limitations that come with it. This project was inspired by the lessons we learned from Joy Buolamwini's book, "Unmasking AI."

        <p>
            The dataset we used for this experiment was put together to be as diverse and representative as possible. It included images and audio files from different environments to help reduce any inherent biases and ensure better accuracy.

        <h2>Training and Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
            We trained our machine learning model using the compiled dataset and evaluated its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. These metrics helped us understand where the model did well and where it still had room for improvement, especially in terms of avoiding biases.

        <h2>Challenges and Reflections</h2>
        <p>
            This project came with its fair share of challengesâ€”from picking the right training data to dealing with biases in the model. Reflecting on these hurdles helped us understand the ethical implications of AI development and why transparency and accountability are so crucial in this field.
